=== Build the Docker container for the function code

ensure riff is running and the `faas` script from `project/riff` is on your `PATH`

from within the `functions/redis-writer` directory execute:

```
faas build -v 1.0.0
faas apply
```

if you'd also like to run an instance of `redis-writer` that subscribes to the
`function-replicas` topic and keeps track of the latest values in a
"demo:function-replicas" hash:

```
faas apply -f function-replicas-writer
```
